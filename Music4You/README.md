An Interactive Website that gives Info about a certain artist that is searched for.

You search for an artist of your choice , we use deezer API to fetch the artist info.

We show the name of the artist and a picture of the artist

and then we fetch the tracks from the deezer API to get the top 5 tracks as links to listen at Deezer .
